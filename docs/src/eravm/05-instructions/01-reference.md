# Reference

In this specification, instructions are grouped by their relevance to the EVM instruction set:

- [Native EVM Instructions](./02-evm/01-reference.md).
- [EVM Assembly Auxiliary Instructions](./03-evm-assembly.md).
- [Yul Auxiliary Instructions](./04-yul.md).

Most of the EVM native instructions are represented in both Yul and EVM assembly IRs. If they are not, it is
stated explicitly in the instruction description.
