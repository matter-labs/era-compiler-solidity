# EraVM Extensions

EraVM extensions are a set of additional instructions that can be expressed in Solidity and Yul, but can only be compiled to EraVM bytecode.

There are two ways of using EraVM extensions with *zksolc*:
1. [Call simulations](#call-simulations) in Solidity.
2. [`verbatim`](#verbatim) function in Yul mode.

### Call simulations

Since *zksolc* could only operate on Yul received from *solc*, it was not possible to add EraVM-specific functionality to Solidity and Yul. Instead, *zksolc* introduced a hack with external call instructions that would be replaced with EraVM-specific instructions during emitting LLVM IR. In such external call instructions, the address argument denotes the instruction type, whereas the rest of the arguments are used as instruction arguments.

Call simulations are the only way to use EraVM extensions in Solidity.

### `verbatim`

In Yul mode, there is a special instruction called `verbatim` that allows emitting EraVM-specific instructions directly from Yul. This instruction is more robust than call simulations, as it allows passing more arguments to the instruction, and it is not affected by the *solc*'s optimizer. Unfortunately, `verbatim` is only available in Yul mode and cannot be used in Solidity.

It is recommended to only use `verbatim` in Yul mode, as it is more robust and less error-prone than call simulations in Solidity.



## Call Types

In addition to EVM-like `call`, `staticcall` and `delegatecall`, EraVM introduces a few more call types:
1. Mimic call
2. System call
3. Raw call

Each of the call types above has [its by-ref modification](#mimic-call-by-reference-0xfff9), which [allows passing pointers](#active-pointers) to ABI data instead of data itself.

### Mimic Call

Mimic call is a call type that allows the caller to execute a call to a contract, but with the ability to specify the address of the contract that will be used as the caller. This is useful for EraVM System Contracts that need to call other contracts on behalf of the user. Essentially, it is a more complete version of `DELEGATECALL`.

For a deeper dive into the Mimic Call, visit [the EraVM formal specification](https://matter-labs.github.io/eravm-spec/spec.html).

### System Call

System call allows passing more arguments to the callee contract using EraVM registers. This is useful for System Contracts that often require auxiliary data that cannot be passed via calldata.

There are also [system mimic calls](#system-mimic-call-0xfffa), which are a combination of both, that is auxiliary arguments can be passed via EraVM registers.

### Raw Call

Raw calls are similar to EVM's `CALL`, `STATICCALL`, and `DELEGATECALL`, but they do not encode the ABI data. Instead, the ABI data is passed as an argument to the instruction. This is useful for EraVM System Contracts that need to call other contracts with a specific ABI data that cannot be encoded in the calldata.



## Active Pointers

Active pointers are a set of calldata and return data pointers stored in global LLVM IR variables. They are not accessible directly from Yul, but they can be used to forward call and return data between contracts.

The number of active pointers is fixed at 10, and they are numbered from 0 to 9. Some instructions can only use the 0th pointer due to the lack of spare arguments to specify the pointer number. In order to use pointers other than the 0th, use [the swap instruction](#active-pointer-swap-0xffd9).

Instructions that use active pointers have a reference to this section.



## Constant Arrays

Constant arrays are a set of global arrays that can be used to store constant values. They are not accessible directly from Yul, but they can be used to store constant values that are used in multiple places in the contract.

Notes:
1. The `input_length` parameter is always set to 0xFFFF or non-zero value. It prevents the *solc*'s optimizer from optimizing the call out.
2. Instructions that do not modify state are using `staticcall` instead of `call`.
3. Instructions such as raw calls preserve the call type, so they act as modifiers of `call`, `staticcall`, and `delegatecall`.

Pseudo-code:
```solidity
size = active_ptr_size()
```

Solidity usage:
```solidity
assembly {
    let size := staticcall(0, 0xFFE2, 0, 0xFFFF, 0, 0)
}
```

Yul usage:
```solidity
assembly {
    let size := verbatim_0i_1o("active_ptr_data_size")
}
```



## Active Pointer: Swap (0xFFD9)

Swaps the Nth and Mth [active pointers](#active-pointers). Swapping allows the active pointer instructions to use pointers other than the 0th.

Pseudo-code:
```solidity
active_ptr_swap(N, M)
```

Solidity usage:
```solidity
assembly {
    let _ := staticcall(N, 0xFFD9, M, 0xFFFF, 0, 0)
}
```

Yul usage:
```solidity
assembly {
    let _ := verbatim_2i_0o("active_ptr_swap", N, M)
}
```



## Active Pointer: Return (0xFFDB)

Returns from the contract, using [the 0th active pointer](#active-pointers) as the return data.

Pseudo-code:
```solidity
active_ptr_return()
```

Solidity usage:
```solidity
assembly {
    let _ := staticcall(0, 0xFFDB, 0, 0xFFFF, 0, 0)
}
```

Yul usage:
```solidity
assembly {
    let _ := verbatim_0i_0o("active_ptr_return_forward")
}
```



## Active Pointer: Revert (0xFFDA)

Reverts from the contract, using [the 0th active pointer](#active-pointers) as the return data.

Pseudo-code:
```solidity
active_ptr_revert()
```

Solidity usage:
```solidity
assembly {
    let _ := staticcall(0, 0xFFDA, 0, 0xFFFF, 0, 0)
}
```

Yul usage:
```solidity
assembly {
    let _ := verbatim_0i_0o("active_ptr_revert_forward")
}
```



## Constant Array: Declare (0xFFE1)

Declares a new [global array of constants](#constant-arrays). After the array is declared, it must be right away filled with values using [the set instruction](#constant-array-set-0xffe0) and declared final using [the finalization instruction](#constant-array-finalize-0xffdf).

Index must be an 8-bit constant value in the range `[0; 255]`.

Size must be a 16-bit constant value in the range `[0; 65535]`.

Pseudo-code:
```solidity
const_array_declare(index, size)
```

Solidity usage:
```solidity
assembly {
    let _ := staticcall(index, 0xFFE1, size, 0xFFFF, 0, 0)
}
```

## Constant Array: Set (0xFFE0)

Sets a value in a [global array of constants](#constant-arrays).

Index must be an 8-bit constant value in the range `[0; 255]`.

Size must be a 16-bit constant value in the range `[0; 65535]`.

Value must be a 256-bit constant value.

Pseudo-code:
```solidity
const_array_set(index, size, value)
```

Solidity usage:
```solidity
assembly {
    let _ := staticcall(index, 0xFFE0, size, 0xFFFF, value, 0)
}
```

> This instruction is not available in Yul as `verbatim`.



## Constant Array: Finalize (0xFFDF)

Finalizes a [global array of constants](#constant-arrays).

Index must be an 8-bit constant value in the range `[0; 255]`.

Pseudo-code:
```solidity
const_array_finalize(index)
```

Solidity usage:
```solidity
assembly {
    let _ := staticcall(index, 0xFFDF, 0, 0xFFFF, 0, 0)
}
```

> This instruction is not available in Yul as `verbatim`.



## Constant Array: Get (0xFFDE)

Gets a value from a [global array of constants](#constant-arrays).

Index must be an 8-bit constant value in the range `[0; 255]`.

Offset must be a 16-bit constant value in the range `[0; 65535]`.

Pseudo-code:
```solidity
value = const_array_get(index, offset)
```

Solidity usage:
```solidity
assembly {
    let value := staticcall(index, 0xFFDE, offset, 0xFFFF, 0, 0)
}
```

> This instruction is not available in Yul as `verbatim`.



## Return Deployed (verbatim-only)

Returns heap data from the constructor.

Since EraVM constructors always return immutables via auxiliary heap, it is not possible to use them for EVM-like scenarios, such as EVM emulators.

Pseudo-code:
```solidity
return_deployed(offset, length)
```

Yul usage:
```solidity
assembly {
    let _ := verbatim_2i_0o("return_deployed", offset, length)
}
```



## Throw (verbatim-only)

Throws a function-level exception.

For a deeper dive into EraVM exceptions, visit [this page](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-protocol/compiler/specification/exception-handling).

Pseudo-code:
```solidity
throw()
```

Yul usage:
```solidity
assembly {
    let _ := verbatim_0i_0o("throw")
}
```
